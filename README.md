# electron-solidworks
An experimentation to use the Solidworks C# API within Electron, using Edge.js for scripting C# within Node.js  


## Purpose
The purpose of this project is for me to practice on my web development skills, driven by my work on the already-existing project [solidworks-submissions-form] (a C# GUI to quickly grade student Solidworks submissions). Along the way, I hope to learn more about Electron, Edge.js (to run C# code within Node.js), and web development skill like HTML/JS/CSS (of which I only have a basic understanding).

This project will realistically do everything the Solidworks Submissions Form can, but with more complexity. However, a GUI built using modern web dev techniques (HTML, JS, and CSS) - instead of "proprietary" Windows GUI tools within Visual Studio - will ultimately be more valuable to me.

Hopefully others searching for Solidworks working with Electron will find this repo useful.

## Disclaimer
I have no idea what I'm doing, this is mostly me hacking around and seeing if I can get Solidworks to play nice with Electron *at all*. None of this code is backed by any "best practices", and I could very likely be taking the wrong approach to many things. Knowing this, I would very much appreciate any guidance from others, such as suggestions / questions / comments on this code.
